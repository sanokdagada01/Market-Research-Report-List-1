<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bifurcation Lesions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-Stent</li><li>Two-Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bifurcation lesions refer to blockages that occur at the branching points of coronary arteries. The market for treating these lesions can be categorized into two main types: One-Stent and Two-Stent approaches. The One-Stent strategy utilizes a single stent to cover the main vessel and provides limited support to the side branch, while the Two-Stent approach involves placing separate stents in both the main vessel and the side branch, offering enhanced support for complex lesions. Each method has distinct clinical outcomes and market preferences.</p></p>
