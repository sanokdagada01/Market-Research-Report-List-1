<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion Venting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flameless Explosion Vents</li><li>Explosion Vents/Panels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The explosion venting market primarily consists of two main types: flameless explosion vents and traditional explosion vents/panels. Flameless explosion vents are designed to mitigate the effects of explosions without allowing flames to escape, making them suitable for environments where fire hazards are a concern. Traditional explosion vents or panels, on the other hand, are engineered to burst under pressure, providing a controlled release of gases and preventing destructive pressure buildup. Both types enhance safety in industrial settings susceptible to dust or gas explosions.</p></p>
