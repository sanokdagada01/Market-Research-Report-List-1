<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Hydraulic Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Acting Drive</li><li>Double Acting Drive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft hydraulic actuators market can be divided into single-acting and double-acting drives. Single-acting drives use hydraulic pressure to move a piston in one direction, relying on external forces, like springs, to return it, making them simpler and lighter. In contrast, double-acting drives harness hydraulic pressure for movement in both directions, providing more precise control and allowing for stronger performance in high-load applications. Both types play crucial roles in aircraft systems, affecting efficiency, weight, and reliability.</p></p>
