<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ACL Reconstruction Procedures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autograft</li><li>Allograft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ACL reconstruction procedures involve repairing a torn anterior cruciate ligament, utilizing grafts for tissue replacement. The market primarily consists of two types: autografts and allografts. Autografts utilize the patient's own tissue, often taken from the hamstring or patellar tendon, promoting better integration but requiring additional recovery time at the donor site. Allografts, sourced from deceased donors, offer quicker recovery but may carry a risk of immune response. Both types are effective, catering to different patient needs and preferences.</p></p>
